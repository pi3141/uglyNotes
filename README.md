# uglyNotes

A note-taking app inspired by Notational Velocity and good old-fashioned apps.

## Philosophy

* free software
* multi-platform
* simple
* stay simple
* ugly (Because you already spend too much time on your computer; I don’t need to make you spend more.)
* interoperable

## Features
* single field for searching or creating new notes (like Notational Velocity).
* notes stored as plain text (or markdown if you want, markdown files are just plain text file).
* notes organized into folders.

## Maybe one day …

### The app might …
* ~~render Markdown~~ (Pandoc with a bash script will build a beautifull website of your notes);
* use a framework other than Tkinter (only if it’s uglier or lighter) ;
* have an ncurses variant (yes, it could be even uglier!) ;
* support customizable keyboard shortcuts and other options via a config file ;
* include icons for users with reading disabilities (though… how would you write notes?) ;
* handle images (e.g., inline images in notes using base64 or another method).

### The app will never …
* sync with anything (there are already plenty of apps that can sync folders);
* encrypt notes (again, there are apps for that);
* cost more than nothing (really, who would pay for such an ugly app?).
