# uglyNotes

A note-taking app inspired by Notational Velocity and good old-fashioned apps.

## Philosophy

* Free software
* Multi-platform
* Simple
* stay simple
* Ugly (Because you already spend too much time on your computer; I don’t need to make you spend more. It’s a utility program, not an ad generator.)
* Interoperable

## Features
* A single field for searching or creating new notes (like Notational Velocity).
* Notes stored as Markdown files.
* Notes organized into folders.

## Maybe one day …

### The app might:
* Render Markdown.
* Use a framework other than Tkinter (only if it’s uglier or lighter).
* Have an ncurses variant (yes, it could be even uglier!).
* Support customizable keyboard shortcuts and other options via a config file.
* Include icons for users with reading disabilities (though… how would they write notes?).
* Handle images (e.g., inline images in notes using base64 or another method).

### The app will never …
* Sync with anything (There are already plenty of apps that can sync folders).
* Encrypt notes (Again, there are apps for that).
* Be expensive (Really, who would pay for such an ugly app?).
